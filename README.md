### About the game
_Lawn of Legends_ is a lawnmower simulator for those who have short attention spans. Mow the lawn while watching a video in the corner! 
We added ambient lawnmower noises so you can really be immersed in lawn-mowing.

### Creators' notes
This was our first time creating a game using JS, HTML and CSS! 
We're proud of the effort and creativity put into the game, and most importantly, we're happy that we were able to learn more about JS/HTML/CSS.
